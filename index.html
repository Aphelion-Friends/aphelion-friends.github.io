            <h2>Project Description</h2>
			<div class="two-column-layout">
				<p>Our project is an online multiplayer first-person extraction shooter game. The game allows players to choose an objective at the start before entering the map, which they then will have high-tension gameplay. In this prototype, we successfully completed all of our level-1 functional requirements, including online multiplayer, an objective system, and an inventory system. The target audience for our game is gamers who are interested in FPS, Co-op, and extraction games as well as high-tension gameplay that will come from our game. Our purpose for the game is make it enjoyable to play, gain a little bit of money once on Steam, and gain experience and knowledge in video game development and networking.</p>
